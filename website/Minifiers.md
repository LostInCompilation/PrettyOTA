# Minifiers to use for PrettyOTA

I don't use any tools to minify the PrettyOTA website code automatically. It's done manually using minifier websites. Not all minifier websites work without issues (especially for CSS), so I included the list of sites which I use and are working.

After the webiste code has been minified (into the `prettyOTA_minify.html` and `login_minify.html` file), you can use the `websiteCompressor.py` script (located in `utils/websiteCompressor.py` to compress the minified file and paste the generated C++ array directly into the PrettyOTA source code.
